# Interprep

Just a repo that I can keep all code that I've done to prep for
interviews or get grips of a new programming language.

## Folder Structure

### leetcode

Home for coding challenges that can be found on [leetcode](https://leetcode.com/problemset/all/). They will be just be organized by the language that I used to solve them.


## But should I leave the answer to this things on the web?

While having this repo public could help people cheat by looking for answers and copy/pasting the code, I just care if people cheat, it's not cool, but whatever. If the place that I took this exercises from has a rule against posting solutions online, I will remove them.
